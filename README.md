# id-class-extractor-from-html intro:

As I'm learning to code, I found out that sometimes if your project is long enough it's not so easy to remember or keep track of every "class" and "id's" you add to your code. 
So I come up with this idea to build something which can help me in my coding process.

## Initial Development:

So I started initially with this idea and tested it many times locally before publishing it for public.

## Who can benefit from this app:
As of now I can't exactly say who can or who can't benefit from this app. But here's the thing. According to me people who are into frontend development and who use's Javascript and Html to write their program or project can hugely benefit from this.

## Who can contribute?
To me, anybody who is interested in developing something and has similar or greater knowledge of web developement languages can contribute.
Please view the license before you start. Thank you.

## Scope of Developement:
The basic idea is to get help while coding. So if you're someone who can create an extension for this [Like:VS-Code]. You're welcome.
